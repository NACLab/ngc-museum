# The Neural Adaptive Computing (NAC) Laboratory

The NAC lab is a computational neuroscience and brain-inspired computing research 
group. The focus of the lab's research is on developing models of cognition and biological neurocircuitry, as well as theories of mind and brain functionality, to construct new learning procedures and architectures that generalize across tasks and continually adapt to novel situations, often with target applications in neurorobotics.
