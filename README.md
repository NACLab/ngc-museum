# NGC-Museum: Neuroscience Models and Biomimetic Agents with NGC-Learn

<b>ngc-museum</b> is a public repository for
<i><a href="https://github.com/NACLab/ngc-learn/">ngc-learn</a></i> that
houses biomimetic, brain-inspired computing, and computational
neuroscience / biophysics models proposed throughout history. All models in
this repo, whether contributed by community, other groups, or the
ngc-learn dev team, are written in Python using ngc-learn (and JAX). Each
model in the `exhibits/` directory or collection of models in the `exhibitors/`
sub-directories contain `README` top-level files that explain their central
properties and general organization of the sub-directory they are found within,
including model/agent simulation instructions, problem task descriptions, as well
as relevant hyper-parameter values need to reproduce experimental results.

For official walkthroughs going over the model exhibits found in this repo, please
visit the ngc-learn documentation page: https://ngc-learn.readthedocs.io/
(under the 
"<a href="https://ngc-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/museum/model_museum.html">Model Museum</a>" 
side-bar). For information, including anything related
to usage instructions and details related to ngc-learn itself, please refer to
the official ngc-learn <a href="https://github.com/NACLab/ngc-learn/">repo</a> (and
its <a href="https://ngc-learn.readthedocs.io/">documentation</a>).

For those contributing models/algorithms in either the `exhibitors/` or
`exhibits/` directories, please send us an [email](mailto:ago@cs.rit.edu) if
you are interested in writing your own walkthrough for us to
include and integrate related to a particular model exhibit that you are
working on in the official ngc-learn documentation as we warmly welcome
the community to contribute to ngc-museum, as it is these contributions
that help ensure various models of biomimetic inference/learning and
brain-inspired computing see application as well as inspire future lines of
scientific inquiry.
